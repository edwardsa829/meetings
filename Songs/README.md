All song videos should be added to the 'Songs' directory maintaining original file names 
as when they were downloaded off the JW website.

Run the script with the _python3_ command as chances are you will run into errors if you run _python_.

You may rename the main directory 'meetings' and place it anywhere on your computer as long as the 'Songs' folder name stays the same and is kept in the main directory.
